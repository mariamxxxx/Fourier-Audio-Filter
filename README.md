# Noise-FIiter
This repository presents an audio signal processing project that synthesizes a piano melody programmatically, contaminates it with random noise, and then applies custom frequency-domain filtering to restore the original music.

Key technologies and methods:

-NumPy for efficient numerical computation and signal synthesis. 

-Matplotlib for in-depth time- and frequency-domain visualization of audio signals.

-SoundDevice for audio playback of generated and filtered signals.

-SciPy FFT for rigorous spectral analysis, enabling precise noise identification and removal.


 
Project highlights:

-Algorithmic composition of "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" using mathematical representations of piano notes.                                                                                                                                                   
-Simulation of realistic signal degradation via dynamic, multi-frequency noise injection.	

-Application of advanced digital filtering techniques in the frequency domain, leveraging the power of the Fourier Transform for signal restoration.

-Thorough comparative analysis using graphical representations and live audio output.



This project stands at the intersection of mathematics, music, and computational signal processing, showcasing a creative and technical method of digital audio analysis.
