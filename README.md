# Noise-FIiter
MATLAB-based piano song synthesis using advanced Fourier Transform techniques. This project generates a song from individual piano notes, introduces complex noise, and applies custom spectral filtering to achieve high-fidelity audio restoration. A deep dive into digital signal processing, music synthesis, and noise reduction.
